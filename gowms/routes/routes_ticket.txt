1. Thinking about restructuring and removing routes.go and instead grouping them in the main func
   as this could be a more efficient way to utilize middleware

2.  Also considering (saw this on stack overflow) someone designs their handlers to be methods on a 
	struct. Using a database connection in the struct and rendering each page/handler is a method.

3. on pages.go - why do i have data as a parameter ? the page is the data ??
