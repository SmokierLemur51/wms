A warehouse management system designed to help track inventory, sales and manage transfers
between warehouses. This particular instance and example is made for a fictional company that 
deals in selling exterior building products (vinyl siding, James Hardie, LP Smartside etc). 
The fictional company is very heavily based off of Lansing Building Products (which I work for)
and targets the inefficiencies and shortcomings of the system we are using now. (wont name names <3)
